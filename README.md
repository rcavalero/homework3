# Password Generator (Homework3)

This application will generate a password between 8 and 128 characters.  The password will be generated using characters from four different character sets:
 1. Special Characters (@#$%)
 2. Numbers (123...789)
 3. Lower Case Letters (abc...xyz)
 4. Upper Case Letters (ABC...XYZ)

For increased security the password requires at least one character from each character set.  Once the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button they will be asked to input a password length followed by prompts to input the number of characters that will be used from each set.  If the user selects the maximum amount of characters for a given set, the remaining sets will default to one character.  The Upper Case letters automatically default to the number characters remaining in the selected length of the password.

Once the password is generated the user will be able to click a button to copy the password to the clipboard.
